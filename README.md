Second Project -- Release 1.0 on May 3 2022
CSc 335
Spring 2022

All parts are due by ***Sunday, May 22, at 23:59***.  
I ask that each team submit a single document containing the developments, proofs and working code, along with tests and the demo requested in Part 3.

---

### Part 1

Design a data type suitable for representing infix propositions, as described in my notes for Class 19.

Give a complete specification and development (including a proof) for a program which inputs a proposition
which uses and (^), or (v), not (-) and implies (=>) and which returns a logically equivalent proposition
using just ^ and - .  Both the input and output should use infix notation.

The lecture given on Tuesday, May 3, will be helpful in completing this assignment.

### Part 2

Give a complete specification and development (including proof) for an interpreter of infix propositions:
your interpreter will input a proposition and an a-list of T,F values for variables, and will return the
computed value of the input proposition using those values for its variables.

Lectures given on Thursday, May 5, and Tuesday, May 10, will be helpful in completing Part 2.

### Part 3

Demonstrate your interpreter by using it in conjunction with the front-end of Part 1.
